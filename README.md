## About

Responding to the need of historians and archaeologists to assess different scenarios on how a set of sites could have interacted in the past, this method, developed in PHP and JavaScript, provides a computational approach to define areas of influence (i.e., relative neighbourhoods) around point locations. It uses these areas to produce adjacency-networks that describe the links and topological structure at various levels of resolution. By applying a series of algorithms and formulae, the application calculates properties such as the degree of 'integration' and 'control' of each node (i.e., town) within the network. This process allows for a nuanced analysis of how individual sites may have played pivotal roles in the social and economic dynamics of ancient regions, revealing patterns of interaction, trade, and influence that would otherwise remain hidden. The integration of PHP and JavaScript ensures that the application is both dynamic and responsive, enabling users to interact with and visualize data effectively, enhancing their understanding of complex historical landscapes.
